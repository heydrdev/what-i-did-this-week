Finally I shifted to Notion this week and migrated all my habit database into it. Earlier I was using Google Sheets for my daily activity tracking.

The best thing about notion is that it is very flexible. I created a **F.O.C.U.S** Template which is loved my many people. This template is based on **The Eisenhower Matrix**, which can help you to organize and prioritize your work without any distractions.

If you are interested and want to try it out, you can  get it for free. Just Retweet this tweet and comment "Sent it" and I'll DM a copy of the Notion template for free.

Or you can buy it from [**Gumroad**](https://heydrdev.gumroad.com) store.

As most of you might not know I am practicing left hand typing on https://www.keybr.com/

I know touch typing and I can type with the average speed of 93 wpm using both the hands. But I wanted to learn single hand typing, don't know if will be beneficial or not, but I am enjoying it.

Here is my Left Hand Typing (LFT) stats.

I am also looking for a good keyboard which is small in width. So that my left hand can cover all the keys. Please let me know in the comment if you know a good keyboard 🤩.
