# What I Did this Week ?
## Week 1

Today is July 1 2022 and I am 19 right now. Why I mentioned my age? Because in next 6 months I am going to enter in my 20's. This actually scares me because I have read a lot what people shares about their experiece of 20's. What you should not do in 20's? What you should do in 20's? Habbits you should build in your 20's? and etc etc... and I have no such habits so far.

I just started reading the book Atomic Habits by James Clear and I am very luck that I started with this book. I want to be reader, it's not because that I personally liked it in the beginning (around in my 6th standard). But I have seen my example of successfull people in any profession who have this habit and this is one of their reason that helped them to be what they are now.

After reading half the book, I literally build one habit and that is brushing in night. Now I can share something which I proud of too.

Here you can see, I am not consistent at everything, but this colour full graph really motiates me. (I am tracking my habit on google sheets right now, but I am planning to move it Notion.)

## Why I am creating a new series?

**Reason 1:** After knowing the power of consistency, I want to build to two more habits, and want to track and share it with you guys. The two new habits are **Reading** and **Writing**. I will explain in future why I choose only these two. But to quickly get and idea.. read this ðŸ‘‡.
